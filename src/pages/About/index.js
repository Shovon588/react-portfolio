                    <h4>Hi, I am Shovon</h4>
                    <p>
                        I am a Software Engineer with a passion for
                        problem-solving and software development. I enjoy
                        building, managing, writing applications at scale. I
                        love building scalable and user-friendly web
                        applications using emerging frameworks, tools, and
                        technologies. Being a problem solver, I like challenges
                        and love to play around and break stuff while learning
                        something new. Apart from that I also have experience in
                        web scraping and web browser automation. I enjoy both
                        strategy and execution - and above all, a great culture
                        (which, extending Drucker a bit, eats them both for
                        breakfast). I would love to work with an innovative team
                        that makes things happen. I am interested in Full Stack
                        Development and building SaaS applications. If you want
                        to talk about serverless technologies, scalable SaaS
                        applications, distributed system design, micro-service
                        architecture, Web 3.0 technologies and business ideas
                        then I am all ears.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Iâ€™m an easy going person and can easily be a part of any
                        team. I enjoy being around different types of people and
                        I like to challenge myself to improve my skills and
                        ability.
